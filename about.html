  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section class="project-block revealed">
    <h2>👋 Hey there!</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Shreya Vontela</strong> — a data scientist who loves turning messy data into
      meaningful, intelligent stories. I started my career crunching numbers in finance and slowly
      fell in love with the world of machine learning, where math meets creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, I work on building <strong>ML models</strong>, <strong>GenAI systems</strong>, and
      exploring the exciting space of <strong>Agentic AI</strong> — teaching machines to think and act
      a little more like humans (the nice kind 😄).
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve worn quite a few hats — from modeling credit losses at JP Morgan, to automating systems at
      Bank of America, to designing new-age AI pipelines. I love the feeling of taking an abstract idea,
      playing with data, and building something that actually makes a difference.

    <h2>🚀 What Keeps Me Going</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a lifelong learner who believes the best solutions happen when tech, intuition, and curiosity
      come together. When I’m not experimenting with models, you’ll probably find me doodling product
      ideas, reading about the future of AI agents, or chasing my next big “what if…?” moment.
